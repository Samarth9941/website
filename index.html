      <p class="text-muted text-left" >TUM TUM ASIA
        A joyful journey that your body, mind and soul experiences.
        To me, food should not be a constant. It should be a joyful journey that your body, mind and soul experiences. And it was on this life-long journey of yummy dishes that Tum Tum Asia was born, not through some epiphany, but out of the cries of the craving bellies of people we have met along the way.
        
        On our travels across Asia, we were fascinated by a fancy ‘Tum Tum’. This motorized vehicle, which is found carrying hungry people with a craving ‘tum’ towards the hidden food holes of these Asian cities and towns, hunting for mouthwatering street eats, captivated us.
        
        We wanted to create an experience that embodies everything we know and love about the street food scene that is so ingrained in Asian culture.
        
        Tum Tum Asia is all about authentic pan Asian cuisine with a twist: all of our dishes are 100% vegetarian. Let us take you on a journey through the streets of China, India, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Japan, in a relaxed, authentic atmosphere where affordable Asian Cuisine and drinks combine to offer a truly unique experience.
        
        From Dim Sums and Satays, to Kebabs and Sushi, we serve up a soulful selection of the very best street bites. Years of research have gone into perfecting our recipes and ensuring each dish tastes authentic and stays true to its roots. At Tum Tum we strongly believe that no meal is complete without amazing tasting beverages, which is why we have created a wide range of refreshing fresh fruit juice blends and street style Goti sodas.
        
        So sit back, relax and let us take you on a journey through the Far East.</p>

      My esteemed colleague Christy Lemire opened her review of “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” with a quote from her nine-year-old asking if he could see it again, so I think there’s some synergy in quoting my nine-year-old to open this one: “That might be the best movie I’ve ever seen.”
      
      “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” explodes onto screens this week, building on the foundation of the masterful “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” with stunning animation, unforgettable characters, and complex themes. The first note I took after seeing it was “so much movie.” Like the work of a young artist who refuses to be restrained by the borders of the frame,    “Across the Spider-Verse” is loaded with incredible imagery and fascinating ideas. It is a smart, thrilling piece of work that reminded me of other great part twos like “The Dark Knight” and “The Empire Strikes Back.” Like those films, it leaves viewers anxiously anticipating the next chapter (which will come in March 2024), and it earns its cliffhangers by grounding them in a story of young people refusing to submit to a concept of what a hero’s arc needs to be.“Across the Spider-Verse” opens just over a year after the action of the first movie. Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) is back in her universe, trying to keep her identity secret from her father, George (Shea Whigham). When an alternate version of the villainous Vulture (Jorma Taccone) drops into her reality, the bad guy ends up trailed by the intense Spider-Man 2099 (Oscar Isaac) and confident Spider-Woman (Issa Rae). They reveal to Gwen that they’re part of a secret Spider-Society that has been cleaning up inter-universe messes, capturing villains who end up in the wrong one and sending them home again. When Gwen’s identity is blown with her dad, she joins the Spider-Crew, correcting the errors of multi-verse.

      Of course, fans will remember that Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) is essentially one of those errors. The Peter Parker of his universe died trying to save him, and the spider that bit Miles was never supposed to be there. But it was. So now what? This story's backbone is about pushing back against determinism and moving forward with what's in front of you. Superhero culture has used multiverse stories to expand on the concept of potential, but this film (and I hope these themes really land in its sequel) suggests that it’s way more important to hold onto the reality in your hands than imagine all of the other ones that might have been. It’s about controlling your own fate more than giving into a scripted narrative of heroism. More than most superhero movies, it’s about empowerment instead of destiny. And that’s powerful stuff.</p>

<h4>Water Wars: The Southwest’s Procrastination Comes Home to Roost</h4>
<img src="AdobeStock_483607795 (1).jpeg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
<p class="list-group-item-success col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Neither rain nor snow nor short-term fixes have ended the great Southwestern drought.DILLON, Colorado – More than 60 years have passed since the Denver Water Board evicted the 800-plus residents of this former gold rush community and inundated the town they called home. Today, the Dillon Reservoir provides much of the water consumed by fast-growing Denver, some 68 miles to the east, and while few residents have living memories of the day Dillon was drowned beneath 220 feet of water, there is still resentment in the air.

  “We’ve had a few lead scares in our local drinking water here, and that water doesn’t even come from our own reservoir,” said Marna Fletcher, a longtime resident, pointing out over the pristine 3,233-acre body of water that sits where her parents grew up. “They send all of Lake Dillon’s water to the city. We don’t get none of it.”
  
  Like so much about water in the American West, the 84 billion gallons sitting in Lake Dillon stir controversy. Summit County, home to working-class Dillon as well as international ski destinations, like Vail, Breckenridge, and Keystone, is no happier to ship its water to Denver than Colorado lawmakers in the Denver statehouse are about supplying California, New Mexico, or Arizona. Worse still, decades of taking the river’s seemingly bottomless munificence for granted have left in place a hodgepodge of ancient laws, assumptions, and precedents that make reasonable compromise devilishly hard.
  
  For years, conservationists, policymakers, and hydrologists have warned that the 1922 Colorado River Compact governing how the vast basin’s water resources are shared no longer reflected reality. The compact, part of what is known as “the Law of the River,” has failed to keep pace with population growth, water-hungry agribusinesses, mining, and power stations, as well as changing attitudes toward the environment. Conflicting demands from Native American tribes, fishermen and hunters, developers, ranchers, and nuclear power plants seem impossible to square. “Senior water rights,” based on the legal doctrine of “temporal priority” dating to miners’ claims in the 1849 California Gold Rush, give ranchers, politicians, and investors whose claims pre-date the 1922 treaty nearly unassailable leverage over water rights inside Colorado’s borders, and many of them have little or no interest in watering lawns in Colorado Springs, Boulder. or the Denver suburbs.
  
  SIDEBAR: The 1922 Colorado River Compact
  The math was wrong from the start.
  
  When the treaty that governs the distribution of the Colorado River’s water was signed in Santa Fe in 1922, New Mexico and neighboring Arizona were celebrating their 10th year of statehood. Herbert Hoover, then secretary of the Commerce for President Warren G. Harding, presided over the signing of what became known as the “Law of the River,” officially the Colorado River Compact of 1922. Testifying before a congressional committee in 1926, he predicted the treaty would guarantee equitable distribution of the river’s bounty even if the region’s population – then about a half million ­­­– were to quadruple.
  
  With many twists and turns involving the U.S. Congress and Supreme Court, the basic structure of the compact remained intact for a century. The 1922 treaty, ratified by Congress, formalized a system of “senior” and “junior” water rights that gives great power to the descendants of the settlers, ranchers, and other early European residents of the region whose claims remain “senior.” Native American tribes, who under such a system might be assumed to have the most “senior” rights, were cut out of the deal, dismissed by Hoover who used the term “wild Indian.” Congress and lawsuits have rectified that to some extent today, but by and large the wealth of the region’s water remains in the hands of landowners generally located far from where the water is so desperately needed.
  
  Today, with about 40 million people and some of the most important agricultural land in America dependent on the river, the 1922 assumptions about the river’s flow look wildly optimistic. But for the better part of a century, the Law of the River held sway. Put simply, the 1922 compact divided the Colorado River Basin into an Upper Basin (Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming) and Lower Basin (Arizona, California, and Nevada), providing each with 7.5 million acre-feet (AF) of water. The Upper Basin states, then little more than outposts in a region dominated by California, agreed to deliver the entire 7.5 million AF due to the Lower Basin before they claimed any water for their own use.
  
  The formula might have worked had the 1922 calculus that estimated the Colorado’s total flow been close to accurate. Assumptions that the Colorado River delivered about 18 million AF annually turned out to be far off base.

      <p class="p_modal">Greg expresses his thoughts on fame, noting that it might attract unwanted attention, so he decides to be best friends with a possible one. After failed attempts to make his best friend Rowley famous, Greg decides to use his brother Rodrick's desire for his band, Löded Diper, to be famous as an opportunity instead, using a familial connection. Rodrick believes that the annual Battle of the Bands might boost their fame, inspired by his favorite band Metallichihuahua (based on Metallica), who won the competition when they were starting out, but broke up before he got a chance to see them play.

        Rodrick attempts to have Löded Diper wear costumes that might establish them as rockstars, but that fails. After several photoshoots that are of no use, the band joins a contest at a local car dealership, where the person who can keep at least one hand on a van the longest gets to keep it as their previous van was rear-ended. The band loses the competition, and they decide to use social media to promote themselves. After getting injured from recording videos of accidents that go viral, Löded Diper brainstorm ideas for a music video, before realizing they need to record a song first to be able to create one.
        
        Greg follows the band to a recording studio downtown, where they are able to finally record a song after several incidents and conflicts. The band then promotes their songs to local radio stations and people they know to no avail, before getting a breakthrough when bassist Drew's brother plays their song at the grocery store he works at; Drew's brother is fired from the grocery store as a result since the manager didn’t like heavy metal music (The type of music Löded Diper plays). Rodrick gets an ice cream truck from the junkyard, and Löded Diper blasts their music on the streets.
        
        Rodrick decides to have the band perform on the rooftop of a building in the middle of the city, which Metallichihuahua had done once. Before they are able to start performing, the band flees down the building's stairs after panicking when grabbing the attention of a woman that lives at the apartment below the roof. They have a run-in with a cop, who fines them for parking in a loading zone. After some more marketing ideas, the band places stickers of their logo around town, catching the attention of the owner of a club named the Headless Chicken, who invites them to play at the club.
        
        After preparing props, Löded Diper hires Greg as a roadie. On the performance's night, Greg and band vocalist Bill sneak into a nearby pizza place to steal an animatronic's drumstick for Rodrick. The show ends up catastrophically, and the owner reveals that the band isn't getting paid for the performance in the first place. Later on, they visit a convention to meet Metallichihuahua guitarist Warwick Sprinter, who gives them advice and explains that his band broke up because of desperate attempts to recover stolen money.
        
        Löded Diper performs at a bar mitzvah successfully before being hired for some more shows and Rodrick considers growing the group's fan base. They head to a festival and sell merch, where they perform to a small audience, which includes Greg and Rodrick's family. The band later visits Metallichihuahua drummer Sebastian Sleeves, who tells them to quit the music business due to the very little chance of getting famous. They later find out about a more successful competing band named Stank, inspiring Rodrick to be more strict on Löded Diper's preparations.
        
        Bill falls in love with a restaurant assistant manager named Becky, who brings the group donuts during practice. After Rodrick forces Bill to break up with her, to Bill's dismay, the group receives a cease and desist letter from a trading card company, which owns a card named Loaded Diaper. Not wanting to risk going into an expensive legal fight, the other members leave the band, and Bill ends up joining Stank. Greg, Drew's brother, and Rodrick's friend Ward replace them and have difficulties practicing.
        
        On the day of the competition, Rodrick plugs his music player into a speaker and Löded Diper mimics their performance, but fail when they realize Rodrick has played the wrong audio. Suddenly, Sebastian, Warwick, Stewart and Wayne get up on stage and start arguing. Metallichihuahua ends up performing and winning the competition before reuniting, while Bill rejoins Löded Diper.
